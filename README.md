# Colorfight AI Script
An algorithm designed to play the game "Colorfight 2." Designed and written using Python at the UCLA [AI]nvasion event sponsored by Green Hills Software and hosted by UCLA ACM. Our AI was able to reach the final rounds of the competition and performed exceedingly well in qualifying brackets.

The replay file (RuntimeTerrorsVictory.cfr) can also be loaded and viewed on the [Colorfight 2 Website](colorfightai.com).

## Game Overview
ColorfightII is a round based game where players try to expand their territory and collect resources to win the game.

There are two kinds of resources:
- Energy
- Gold

Each player starts with an initial amount of energy and a home cell. Each cell controlled by the player during a round will provide gold and energy.

Players can use energy to attack and occupy other cells to expand their territory and gain more gold and energy per turn.

Players can use gold to build different buildings on their own cells to enhance their effects.

At the end of the game, the player with the most gold wins.
